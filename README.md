# Life-Insurance-Risk-Assessment-Model
This project leverages the power of Machine Learning (ML) to revolutionize traditional life insurance risk assessment. By utilizing sophisticated algorithms, we analyze extensive datasets to extract insights that can enhance accuracy in predicting risk.

# Overview
In the insurance industry, assessing risk is critical for determining premiums and coverage terms. Traditional methods rely heavily on limited datasets and predefined factors. However, with the growing availability of complex and diverse data, Machine Learning offers a more dynamic and comprehensive approach.

# Methodology 
I've built a Life Insurance Risk Assessment model using a Random Forest classifier. The model is trained and validated on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, chosen for its comprehensive representation of risk factors. This approach leverages the Random Forest algorithm's ability to handle complex, nonlinear relationships within the data, ensuring a robust and accurate risk prediction framework.
